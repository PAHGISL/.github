Welcome to the GitHub organization of **PAHGISL**, based at the **University of Sydney** within the School of Life and Environmental Sciences and the Sydney Institute of Agriculture.

## 🌏 About Us

We are a research group dedicated to modelling and understanding the spatiotemporal variability of agricultural and environmental systems. By integrating **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)**, **Process-Based Modelling**, and **Data Science**, we develop tools to monitor soil health, predict crop yields, and model hydrological processes at scales ranging from the field to the continent.

Our work bridges the gap between fundamental environmental science and on-farm decision-making, leveraging big data to create "Digital Twins" of agricultural landscapes.

### 🔬 Core Research Themes

* **Precision Agriculture (PA):** * Data-driven site-specific crop management (SSCM).
    * Yield gap analysis and constraint identification using machine learning.
    * On-farm experimentation and sensor fusion.
* **Pedometrics & Digital Soil Mapping (DSM):**
    * 3D soil mapping using proximal and remote sensing.
    * Modelling soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and soil moisture.
    * Quantifying uncertainty in environmental predictions.
* **Hydrology & Remote Sensing:**
    * Land-surface temperature (LST) downscaling and monitoring.
    * Ecohydrological modelling and drought assessment.
    * Nowcasting and forecasting environmental properties (e.g., soil water balance).

## 🛠️ Technologies & Methodologies

Our research relies on a robust stack of spatial data science tools:

* **Languages:** `R` (geostatistics, modelling), `Python` (machine learning, image processing)
* **Data Sources:** Satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS), Proximal soil sensors (Gamma radiometrics, EM38), Climate data (SILO, BOM).
* **Methods:** Spatiotemporal Kriging, Random Forests, XGBoost, Gaussian Processes, Cubist.
